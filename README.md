#### Introduction
This project is part of the Node.js course at Softech. Its main goal is to build a RESTful API using Express.js, a powerful and popular framework for backend development with Node.js.

#### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hieu532004/NODEJS.git
   cd NODEJS/RESTful-API-Express
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will run in development mode at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in the configuration file).

#### Key Features
- Support for basic HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.
- RESTful routing for managing resources.
- Integration of essential middleware such as body-parser, cors, and logger.

#### Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the main source code of the project.
- `routes/`: Defines the API routes.
- `controllers/`: Handles business logic for each route.
- `models/`: Defines data models (if applicable).
- `middlewares/`: Contains custom middleware.

#### Notes
